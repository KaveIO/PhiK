This section contains materials on how to use the Phi_K correlation analysis code.
There are additional side notes on how certain aspects work and where to find parts of the code.
For more in depth explanations on the functionality of the code-base, try the `API docs <phik_index.html>`_.

The tutorials are available in the ``python/phik/notebooks`` directory. We have:

* A basic tutorial: this covers the basics of calculating Phi_K, the statistical significance, and interpreting the correlation. 
* An advanced tutorial: this shows how to use the advanced features of the ``PhiK`` library.
* A spark tutorial: this shows how to calculate the Phi_K correlation matrix for a spark dataframe.

You can open these notebooks directly:

* Run them interactively at `MyBinder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KaveIO/PhiK/master?filepath=python%2Fphik%2Fnotebooks>`_.
* View them statically: `basic tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/kaveio/phik/master/python/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_basic.ipynb>`_ and  the `advanced tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/kaveio/phik/master/python/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_advanced.ipynb>`_ and the `spark tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/kaveio/phik/master/python/phik/notebooks/phik_tutorial_spark.ipynb>`_.
